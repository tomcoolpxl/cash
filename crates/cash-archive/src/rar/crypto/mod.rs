/// Reference builds copy the password into a 128-element `wchar_t` buffer and
/// keep 127 entries plus a terminator, so nothing past character 127 reaches
/// the KDF. Measured against RAR 7.12: a 133-character password and its first
/// 127 characters open the same archive, and the first 126 do not.

/// Without this rars derives a key no official tool can reproduce, in both
/// directions: it cannot open a WinRAR archive when handed the same long
/// password, and the archives it writes from character 128 on cannot be opened
/// by WinRAR with that password or with any prefix of it. The boundary is
/// sharp, so a password of exactly 127 characters is untouched.
///
/// A character here is a Unicode scalar, which matches the Linux reference
/// where `wchar_t` is 4 bytes wide. The Windows build has a 2-byte `wchar_t`
/// and so keeps 127 UTF-16 code units instead. The two disagree only for a
/// password carrying astral characters past position 127, where they derive
/// different keys from each other, so no single rule matches both. Scalars win
/// here because truncating UTF-16 can split a surrogate pair, and a Rust `str`
/// cannot hold the lone surrogate that would produce.
