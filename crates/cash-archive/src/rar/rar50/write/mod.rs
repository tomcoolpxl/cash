/// almost double the one just under. That rounding is why a flat multiple of the
/// dictionary never described this well. It used to charge twelve times the
/// dictionary, which is the middle of the eight-to-sixteen the rounding then
/// produced, so it over-charged a dictionary that was already a power of two and
/// came close to under-charging one that had just crossed.
///
/// Peak resident bytes for one member encode, over the member itself, taken on a
/// 16 MiB member so every window is filled:

///    8 MiB     36,941,824    33,554,432

///
/// The links account for the whole shape; what is left is the hash heads, the
/// token buffer for one block, and the packed output. Three megabytes covers
/// those with room to spare, and the fifth byte per window position absorbs the
/// rest rather than pretending to predict it.
///
/// The optimal parse searches a binary tree instead of hash chains, and a tree
/// holds two links per window position where a chain holds one. So it is eight
/// bytes per byte of window rather than four, and the charge doubles the links
/// and keeps the one byte of slack. Measured on the same 16 MiB member, over
