//! Taken from [rars](https://github.com/bitplane/rars) 0.10.0, © its authors, under the

//! as `NOTICE` lists. Every file of this module came from it. Its features (`write`,
//! `parallel`, `recovery`, `encryption`) are cash-archive's, all on; its secrets are
//! cleared by `crypto::wipe` where rars used the `zeroize` crate, and the AES ciphers'
//! round keys by the `aes` crate's own `zeroize` feature.

// Taken from rars, written to other rules: the style lints it was not written to are
// allowed rather than rewritten (as for sevenz). The lints for code that can panic apply
// in full: what an archive can reach is an error, and what cannot fail says why.
