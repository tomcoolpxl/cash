//! Every writer used to answer this for itself, in about thirty functions that
//! nearly all ended the same way: build the set of features this shape of
//! archive is allowed, compare it with what the caller asked for, and on a
//! mismatch return a fixed string that never said which option was the problem.
//! A caller who asked for two things and could only have one was told "writer
//! feature is not supported" and left to work out which.
//!
//! So capability is data here, keyed by format and by the shape of the archive
