//! Data filters: the reversible transforms a writer applies to a member before
//! compressing it, so the encoder sees something it can match on.
//!
//! Every RAR family that has filters at all draws from this set, but no family
//! encodes all of it. RAR 5 has four builtin filter types; the RAR 2.9 family
//! ships six filters as RarVM programs; delta and the two x86 filters are the
//! only ones common to both. Asking a writer for a filter it cannot encode is
//! rejected when the archive is written, not when the filter is named, because
//! the format is chosen at the same moment and often from the same argument.
