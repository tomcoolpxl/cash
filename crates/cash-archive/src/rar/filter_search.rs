//! Choosing a filter for a member, for any format that has filters.
//!
//! The expensive part of picking a filter is that judging one means compressing
//! the member with it. Doing that for every filter a format offers, times every
//! region a scanner proposes, is most of the cost of writing an archive and
//! nearly all of it is spent proving that filters which were never going to help
//! do not help.
//!
//! So the candidates are cut down before any whole-member encode happens.
//! Filters with a structural detector behind them get their regions from the
//! detector and a sample encode per region to confirm the detector was not
//! fooled by chance byte patterns and to drop the regions where the filter
//! would cost more than it saves. The x86 pair detect code by its opcodes; the
//! table scanner detects arrays of fixed-size records by the stride they
//! repeat at, and its regions become ranged delta filters at the record size.
//! Filters with no detector are measured on a sample of the member and have to
//! win by a clear margin to earn a whole-member encode. What survives is a
//! handful of finalists, each encoded once at the caller's real settings,
//! smallest wins.
//!
//! The unfiltered member is always one of the finalists, so the result can never
//! be larger than leaving the data alone.
