//! Match finders shared by the LZ encoders.
//!
//! [`MatchFinder`] is a hash chain. Positions are indexed into a
//! single-bucket-per-hash chain: `head` maps a hash of the `MIN_MATCH` bytes
//! at a position to the most recently inserted position, and `prev` links each
//! inserted position to the previous position with the same hash. Walking a
//! chain therefore visits candidates from the smallest distance to the
//! largest, so callers can stop as soon as a candidate falls outside their
//! window. Inserting costs one store, so a caller can skip past bytes it has
//! already decided about for free, which is what the lazy encoders do.
//!
//! [`TreeMatchFinder`] keeps the positions sharing a hash in a binary tree
//! ordered by the bytes that follow them, after LZMA. One descent finds every
//! improving match and re-hangs the tree under the new position, and each node
//! on the way down narrows a proven-prefix bound, so the descent never re-reads
//! bytes it has already matched. That is what a deep chain walk cannot avoid,
//! and why the tree serves the optimal parse, which searches at every position
//! anyway. The price is that inserting *is* a descent, so history cannot be
//! seeded cheaply, and the tree costs eight bytes per byte of window against
//! the chain's four.
//!
//! `prev` holds one link per position in a window rather than one per position
//! in the input, indexed by position modulo the window. A link is only followed
//! while the candidate it names is inside the window, and a slot is only reused
//! once the position it held has fallen out, so the two never overlap. That
//! bounds the finder by the window instead of by the data, which is what lets
//! one finder span every block of a member: rebuilding it per block meant
//! rehashing the whole history each time, which measured at about 40% of the
//! encode on a 16 MiB member.
//!
//! Links are 32 bits, so the window costs four bytes per byte it covers rather
//! than eight, and twice as many links share a cache line. Positions past four
//! gigabytes keep only their low half; `resolve` measures back from the newest
//! position inserted to recover the rest.
